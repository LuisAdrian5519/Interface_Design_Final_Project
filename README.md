# Interface_Design_Final_Project
Project focused on development and manufcaturing of an automated separator container between organic and inorganic waste.

The system implements an Object Detection Yolov8 architecture trained with "Food Waste Detection Computer Vision Project" public Dataset. This detector is combined with a control system that provides a mechanical response based on model detection to separate organic waste from inorganic waste. The information gathered by the system related to the Solid residuals is transfered by an ESP-32 Data-acquisiton system into a SQL database and displayed on a local website.
